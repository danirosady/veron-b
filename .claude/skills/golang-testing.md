**Persona:** You are a Go engineer who treats tests as executable specifications. You write tests to constrain behavior, not to hit coverage targets.

**Thinking mode:** Use `ultrathink` for test strategy design and failure analysis. Shallow reasoning misses edge cases and produces brittle tests that pass today but break tomorrow.

**Orchestration mode:** Use `ultracode` for auditing a large test suite — orchestrate the three sub-agents described in Audit mode (unit quality and coverage gaps, integration isolation, goroutine/race issues) and merge their findings into one gap report.

**Modes:**

- **Write mode** — generating new tests for existing or new code. Work sequentially through the code under test; use `gotests` to scaffold table-driven tests, then enrich with edge cases and error paths.
- **Review mode** — reviewing a PR's test changes. Focus on the diff: check coverage of new behaviour, assertion quality, table-driven structure, and absence of flakiness patterns. Sequential.
- **Audit mode** — auditing an existing test suite for gaps, flakiness, or bad patterns (order-dependent tests, missing `t.Parallel()`, implementation-detail coupling). Launch up to 3 parallel sub-agents split by concern: (1) unit test quality and coverage gaps, (2) integration test isolation and build tags, (3) goroutine leaks and race conditions.
- **Debug mode** — a test is failing or flaky. Work sequentially: reproduce reliably, isolate the failing assertion, trace the root cause in production code or test setup.

**Dependencies:**

- gotests: `go install github.com/cweill/gotests/gotests@latest`

# Go Testing Best Practices

This skill guides the creation of production-ready tests for Go applications.

## Best Practices Summary

1. Table-driven tests MUST use named subtests -- every test case needs a `name` field passed to `t.Run`
2. Integration tests MUST use build tags (`//go:build integration`) to separate from unit tests
3. Tests MUST NOT depend on execution order -- each test MUST be independently runnable
4. Independent tests SHOULD use `t.Parallel()` when possible
5. NEVER test implementation details -- test observable behavior and public API contracts
6. Packages with goroutines SHOULD use `goleak.VerifyTestMain` in `TestMain` to detect goroutine leaks
7. Use testify as helpers, not a replacement for standard library
8. Mock interfaces, not concrete types
9. Keep unit tests fast (< 1ms), use build tags for integration tests
10. Run tests with race detection in CI
11. Include examples as executable documentation
12. Test files MUST be named after the source file under test, not after the function or method being tested
13. Test functions SHOULD appear in the same order as the functions/methods they test in the source file

## Table-Driven Tests

Table-driven tests are the idiomatic Go way to test multiple scenarios. Always name each test case.

```go
func TestCalculatePrice(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name     string
        quantity int
        unitPrice float64
        expected  float64
    }{
        {
            name:      "single item",
            quantity:  1,
            unitPrice: 10.0,
            expected:  10.0,
        },
    }

    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            got := CalculatePrice(tt.quantity, tt.unitPrice)
            if got != tt.expected {
                t.Errorf("CalculatePrice(%d, %.2f) = %.2f, want %.2f",
                    tt.quantity, tt.unitPrice, got, tt.expected)
            }
        })
    }
}
```

## Quick Reference

```bash
go test ./...                          # all tests
go test -run TestName ./...            # specific test by exact name
go test -race ./...                    # race detection
go test -cover ./...                   # coverage summary
go test -bench=. -benchmem ./...       # benchmarks
go test -fuzz=FuzzName ./...           # fuzzing
go test -tags=integration ./...        # integration tests
```
